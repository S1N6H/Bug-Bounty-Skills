  Master router for bug-bounty hunting with AI agents. Routes any security-testing request to the
  right specialized skill: it detects where you are in the hunt (understand, recon, hunt,
  discipline, validation, reporting) and names the minimal skill set to load before acting.
  Use at the start of any authorized security assessment, when switching targets, when unsure
  what to run next, or when asking "where am I in the process?" / "what should I do next?".

# Master Router — Bug Bounty Skill Dispatcher

The entry point for bug-bounty hunting. It fingerprints the target and classifies the task,
names the **minimal** set of specialized skills, and tells you to read them before acting.
It **dispatches and composes** — it does not re-teach hunting techniques.

## When to use

- At the **start of any authorized security assessment** — decide which skill(s) to load.
- When the user names a target, says "test this", "look for bugs", or asks "which skill should I use?".
- When switching targets or rotating.

**When *not* to use:** once the right skill is loaded and the task is squarely inside it, work
from that skill — don't re-run the router every turn. Re-route only when the task **pivots** to a
new stage (router step 3).

## Routing algorithm

1. **Classify the task** — is it "understand the target", "map the surface", "hunt a bug class",
   "stay disciplined", "prove a finding", or "write the report"?
2. **Detect the target** — web app? API? which archetype? (see `skills/understand/application-archetypes`)
3. **Read the routing table below** → load the minimal skill set for that stage.
4. **Read the chosen skill(s) fully** before acting.
5. **Re-route on pivot** — new evidence that moves you to another stage loads that stage's skills.

## Routing table

| Stage | Skills (read before acting) |
|---|---|
| **Understand** | `application-archetypes` → `application-model-builder` |
| **Map surface** | `web2-recon` |
| **Hunt** | `web2-vuln-classes` · `business-logic-hunter` · `api-security` |
| **Discipline** | `domain-scoped-hunting` (load **before** any hunt) |
| **Prove** | `false-positive-killer` → `triage-validation` |
| **Deliver** | `attack-path-builder` → `report-writing` |

Default session order: Understand → Map → Discipline → Hunt → Prove → Deliver.
Every output uses the shared evidence schema below (stage 5 of this file).

## RESPONSE-DRIVEN NEXT ACTIONS

| You See | You Are In | Next Move |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 403 on all requests to endpoint | Recon/Discovery | Run 403 bypass checklist (headers, method swap, path variation). 5 min → skip. |
| 200 but body is SPA catch-all | Recon | Not a real endpoint. Try `.json`, `/api` prefix, format param. |
| Error stack trace on bad input | Discovery → Prove | Deepen error probe, chain to info disclosure, look for debug endpoints. |
| Timing diff on user-exists | Discovery → Prove | Automate enumeration → password spray or ATO chain. |
| WAF block page (403/406/429) | Discovery | Try Content-Type switch, HTTP/2→1.1, IP rotation. 5 min → kill path. |
| IDOR-confirmed (A reads B data) | Prove → Chain | Check if same IDOR affects PUT/DELETE → chain to data mod or ATO. |
| Race condition success (2x200, 2x change) | Prove | Verify ledger — both changes persisted? → financial impact chain. |
| 401 without token, 200 with any token | Mapping | Auth exists but weak ACL. Focus on IDOR, BOLA, mass assignment. |
| JWT in response with `role` field | Mapping → Prove | None-alg, weak secret, role tamper → chain to admin access. |
| GraphQL introspection on | Mapping → Discovery | Schema leak → field auth bypass → batching for mass PII. |
| Sibling endpoint found mid-session | Mapping | Re-score, add to model, generate new hypotheses. |

## WEAK PATH CANCELLATION (Stop Early, Save Time)

Kill the current path immediately when:
- 3 consecutive 403s with no bypass → STOP (auth gated)
- 5 min of recon on a host → SKIP (5-minute rule)
- 20 min on an endpoint with no signal → ROTATE (20-minute rule)
- A vs B sessions return identical data → STOP (no IDOR)
- `unique constraint` on race test → STOP (serialized)
- Confirmed intended behavior → STOP
- Score < 40 after 2 clean tests → STOP
- WAF blocking 3 different payload approaches → STOP

DEFER (don't kill) when:
- New technology detected mid-session → re-evaluate
- Score jumps 15+ points from new evidence → re-prioritize
- Chain opportunity appears for a low-sev finding
- Target just deployed an update

## EVIDENCE SCHEMA INTEGRATION

Every phase output must use the shared evidence schema below:
```yaml
evidence_id: "OBS-NNN" | phase: "recon"|"model"|"hunt"|"chain"|"validate"
type: "request"|"response"|"diff"|"observation"
source: "header"|"JS"|"API"|"curl"|"diff" | actor: "guest"|"user_a"|"user_b"|"admin"
signal: "sequential_id"|"missing_403"|"role_field"|"error_stack"|"timing_diff"
action: "exact curl/request" | expected: "what should happen" | actual: "what happened"
confidence: 0.3-1.0 | impact: "real" | reproducible: true|false
chain_candidate: false
```

No evidence → no claim → kill it.
